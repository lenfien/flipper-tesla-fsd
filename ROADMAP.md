# Roadmap

Derived from `enhauto-re/COMMANDS.md` table 2a — the set of Commander
actions whose CAN frame templates are already documented in public sources
and can be implemented on our existing MCP2515 + Flipper stack without any
new hardware or vendor firmware.

## Already shipped (v2.3.0)

- FSD unlock HW3/HW4/Legacy (`0x3FD` / `0x3EE`)
- Force FSD (bypass Traffic Light requirement)
- Speed profile control + fastest default
- Nag killer (EPAS `0x370` counter+1 echo)
- ISA speed chime suppression (`0x399`)
- Emergency vehicle flag (HW4 bit59)
- OTA detection + auto TX pause (monitor `0x318`)
- Operation modes: Active / Listen-Only / Service
- CRC / TX / RX counters + wiring warning
- Battery preconditioning (`0x082` byte[0]=0x05 @ 500ms)
- Live BMS dashboard (`0x132` / `0x292` / `0x312`)

## Tier 1 — trivial ports (one handler each, shared infra already in place)

Each of these is structurally identical to what we already do for the FSD
frame: read an incoming frame by CAN ID, flip a bit or overwrite a byte,
retransmit. Estimated ~30 LOC each.

- [ ] `HazardLights` toggle via `0x273 VCFRONT_lighting`
- [ ] `FrontFogLights` / `RearFogLights` / `AllFogLights` (`0x273` bits)
- [ ] `HighBeamStrobe` (`0x273` bit, timed burst)
- [ ] `RearDRL` (`0x273` bit)
- [ ] `ForceManualHighBeam` (`0x273`)
- [ ] `AutoHighBeamOff` (`0x273` disable bit)
- [ ] `MuteSpeedLimitWarning` (block `0x399` more aggressively than current chime suppression)
- [ ] `AutoWipersOff` / `KeepWipersOff` (`0x3E2 VCFRONT_wipers`)
- [ ] `BackWindowHeater` toggle (`0x3B3 HVAC_status`)
- [ ] `RearVentAlwaysOn` / `RearVentAlwaysOff` (`0x2E1 VCRIGHT_hvacStatus`)
- [ ] `Recirc` toggle (`0x2E5 HVAC_Command`)

## Tier 2 — stateful handlers (need small state machine)

- [ ] `FollowDistance` full mapping to speed profile (partial today, expose as first-class toggle)
- [ ] `GearShift` / `SimulatePARK` via `0x229 SCCM_rightStalk` — needs stalk emulation
- [ ] `ChargePort` open/close via `0x102 VCLEFT_chargingHandleStatus`
- [ ] `FoldMirrors` / `MirrorsDip` / `MirrorsDim` (`0x273` bits) — read current state, toggle
- [ ] `StoppingMode` select (`0x293`)
- [ ] `TractionControl` off (`0x2A1 ESP_status`)
- [ ] `TrackMode` enter/exit (`0x293` + `0x2B9`)
- [ ] `WiperMode` cycle / `WipersWasher` pulse (`0x3E2`)

## Tier 3 — needs read-parse-decide (already have BMS pattern to copy)

- [ ] `DriveModeAccel` / `DriveModeRegen` / `DriveModeSteering` (parse `0x118 DI_vehicleStatus`, write `0x293`)
- [ ] `HVAC_Blower` / `HVAC_On` / `HVAC_DefogDefrost` (`0x2E5`) — need current HVAC state
- [ ] `CabinTemp` / `CabinTempLeft` / `CabinTempRight` — current temp read, setpoint write
- [ ] Seat heat family: `FrontSeatHeatLeft/Right`, `RearSeatHeatLeft/Right/Central/All`, `AllSeatHeat`, `SteeringWheelHeat` (`0x2E1` bitfield)
- [ ] `FrontSeatVentLeft` / `FrontSeatVentRight` (`0x2E1`)
- [ ] `TrackModeStability` / `TrackModeHandling` sliders (`0x2B9` — the 0/10/20/…/100 bucket enum visible in .so symbols)

## Tier 4 — multi-frame / safety-gated

- [ ] `Suspension` / `RideHandling` via `0x204 VCFRONT_airSuspension` — guard against run-while-driving
- [ ] Window family: `VentWindows`, `VentLeft`, `VentRight`, `FrontLeftWindow`, `FrontRightWindow`, `RearLeftWindow`, `RearRightWindow` (`0x3E3`)
- [ ] `MediaControl` / `Sounds` / `PlaidLightsControl` / `LightStripBrightness` (`0x2F1 UI_audioStatus` + `0x264` + `0x273`)
- [ ] `DynamicBrakeLights` (`0x273`)

## Out of scope (until we get a real Commander to sniff)

Table 2b in `enhauto-re/COMMANDS.md`. These need byte-level templates that
only exist in Commander firmware: `DisableMotor`, `ParkBrake`,
`DriverMoveSeat` / `PassengerMoveSeat`, seat profile save/restore,
`PresentingDoors*`, `PresentingTrunk*`, `HandWash`, `SuspensionByGear`,
`AutoWindowDrop`, `CameraOnFoldMirrors`, `Grok`, `KickdownSport`,
`RainbowMode*`, `SplitLedStrip`, etc.

## Out of scope (Tesla Fleet HTTP API, not CAN)

Table 1 in `enhauto-re/COMMANDS.md`. These are proper Tesla Fleet API
commands (Frunk/Trunk, DoorLock/Unlock, HonkHorn, FlashLights, Bioweapon,
DogMode, CampMode, KeepClimateOn, SetTemps, ChargeOpen/Close,
GarageDoorOpenClose, SpeedLimit, Wake, RemoteBoombox, etc.). They belong in
a companion web console, not on the Flipper — the Flipper core has no
native WiFi.

## Shape of the work

All Tier 1 and most of Tier 2 can land as a single PR that introduces a
generic **"Extras" scene** — a scrollable list of one-shot toggles that
share the existing MCP2515 / OpMode / OTA-pause gating infrastructure.
Adding a new toggle becomes: drop a handler in `fsd_logic/extras/`, add an
entry to the scene list. That's a cheap architectural change that unlocks
~20 of the items above in one go.

Tier 3 needs a small "vehicle state cache" so we can show current values
(HVAC temps, seat heat levels) before a user flips them. This is an
extension of the BMS pattern we already have — same `state->*_seen` flag
pattern, same mutex discipline.

Tier 4 should be gated behind an explicit safety confirm prompt because
they affect vehicle dynamics or exterior lighting.
